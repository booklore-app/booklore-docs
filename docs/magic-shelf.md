# ‚ú® Magic Shelves

Magic Shelves are dynamic, rule-based collections based on **book metadata fields** that automatically organize your books based on filters you define, like *"Unread Sci-Fi Books from the 1980s"* or *"Books Rated 4+ Stars and Finished Last Month."*

> ‚ú® **Magic Shelves = Dynamic Smart Playlists for Your Books!**

They eliminate the need for manual categorization and keep your collections up to date as your library grows and changes.

Whenever you add a new book, edit existing metadata, or change your reading status, Magic Shelves automatically update to reflect these changes, ensuring your collections are always current.

- üîÑ **Real-Time Updates**: As books are added, edited, or metadata changes, Magic Shelves update automatically.
- üß† **Nested Logic**: Combine multiple conditions using AND/OR groups for flexible, complex filtering.
- üìö **Always Fresh**: No need to manually move books in or out; Magic Shelves stay current based on your rules.

## üìù Detailed Instructions for Creating Rules

### üß© Rule Anatomy

Each rule consists of three main components:

- **Field**  
  The book metadata field to evaluate.  
  _Example:_ "Title", "Author", "Rating", "Library", etc.  
  _E.g.:_ Field = **Title**

- **Operator**  
  How the metadata field is evaluated.  
  _Example operators:_ "equals", "greater than", "contains", etc.  
  _E.g.:_ Operator = **contains**

- **Value(s)**  
  The value(s) to compare against.  
  _Example:_ a word, a number, or a list of categories.  
  _E.g.:_ Value = **"dragon"**

**Sample Rule:**  
_Title_ **contains** _"dragon"_

You can combine multiple rules into a **group**, joined by either `AND` (all must match) or `OR` (any can match). Groups can also be nested to form complex logic trees.
