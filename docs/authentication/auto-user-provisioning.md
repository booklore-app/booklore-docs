# 🚀 Automatic User Provisioning

Streamline user onboarding with automatic user provisioning for OIDC authentication. Let Booklore automatically create user accounts when users log in through your OIDC provider, eliminating manual account creation and reducing administrative overhead.

:::info[OIDC Required]
Automatic user provisioning is only available when OIDC authentication is enabled. Users logging in through internal authentication must still be created manually.
:::

## 🌟 What You'll Achieve

With automatic user provisioning enabled, you can:

- **Eliminate manual user creation** for OIDC-authenticated users
- **Streamline onboarding** by allowing new users to access Booklore immediately after first login
- **Standardize permissions** by assigning default roles and library access automatically
- **Reduce administrative burden** with self-service account creation
- **Control access levels** through configurable default permissions and libraries
- **Maintain security** while providing seamless user experience

## ✨ How Automatic Provisioning Works

### 🔄 The Provisioning Flow

Understanding the automatic provisioning flow helps you configure appropriate defaults:

1. **👤 New User Attempts Login**  
   A user who doesn't exist in Booklore attempts to log in through your OIDC provider (e.g., Pocket ID, Authentik). The user must successfully authenticate with the OIDC provider.

2. **🔍 Booklore Checks User Existence**  
   After successful OIDC authentication, Booklore receives user information from the OIDC provider including username, email, and display name based on your configured claim mappings.

3. **⚡ Automatic Account Creation**  
   If auto-provisioning is enabled and no matching user exists, Booklore automatically creates a new user account with:
   - Username from the configured username claim
   - Email from the configured email claim
   - Display name from the configured name claim
   - Default permissions you've configured
   - Access to default libraries you've selected

4. **✅ Access Granted**  
   The newly provisioned user is immediately logged in and can start using Booklore with their assigned permissions and library access.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Understanding Auto-Provisioning Settings

When you enable automatic user provisioning, you control exactly what new users can do:

#### 🔐 Default Permissions

Choose which permissions automatically provisioned users receive. All users get "Read Books" by default, and you can add:

- **Upload Books** - Allow users to add new books to libraries
- **Download Books** - Enable book downloads in various formats
- **Edit Book Metadata** - Grant permission to modify book information
- **Manage Library** - Allow library management and organization
- **Email Book** - Enable sending books via email
- **Delete Book** - Grant permission to remove books from libraries
- **KOReader Sync** - Enable KOReader device synchronization
- **Kobo Sync** - Allow Kobo device synchronization
- **Access OPDS** - Grant access to OPDS catalog feeds

#### 📚 Default Libraries

Select which libraries newly provisioned users can access. Users will only see and interact with books in their assigned libraries.

:::tip[Permission Strategy]
Start with minimal permissions and expand access as needed. It's easier to grant additional permissions than to revoke them after users have started working with the system.

## 🚀 Enabling Automatic Provisioning

### Step 1: Ensure OIDC is Configured

Before enabling automatic provisioning, you must have OIDC authentication properly configured and tested:

#### 1. Complete OIDC Setup

If you haven't already configured OIDC authentication, follow one of our comprehensive integration guides:

**📚 Setup Guides:**
- [**Authentik Integration Guide**](./authentik.md)
- [**Pocket ID Integration Guide**](./pocket-id.md)

This is what the UI will look like once OIDC setup is complete:

![Enable Auto-Provisioning](/img/authentication/auto-provisioning/auto-provision-1--setup-oidc.jpg)

#### 2. Test OIDC Login with Existing User

Before enabling auto-provisioning, test authentication with a user that already exists in Booklore:

1. **Create a test user** in Booklore manually (if you don't have one)
2. **Ensure the username matches** what your OIDC provider will send in the configured username claim
3. **Attempt to log in** using the OIDC provider
4. **Verify successful login** and that user information displays correctly

:::danger[Critical: Test Before Enabling Auto-Provisioning]
**Always test OIDC authentication with a known user account before enabling automatic provisioning.**

This verification ensures:
- ✅ Your claim mappings are correct
- ✅ User attributes (username, email, name) are extracted properly
- ✅ The OIDC flow completes successfully
- ✅ You won't provision users with incorrect or missing information

**If this test fails, fix your OIDC configuration before proceeding.**
:::

#### 3. Review Claim Data (Optional but Recommended)

To ensure claims contain expected data:

1. **Check your OIDC provider's logs** or user profile to verify claim values
2. **Use browser developer tools** (F12 → Network tab) during login to inspect JWT tokens
3. **Confirm claim names and values** match your Booklore configuration

:::tip[Ready to Proceed]
Once OIDC authentication works reliably with existing users, you're ready to enable automatic provisioning!
:::

---

### Step 2: Enable Auto-Provisioning

Now configure automatic provisioning with appropriate defaults:

![Enable Auto-Provisioning](/img/authentication/auto-provisioning/auto-provision-2--enable-auto-prov.jpg)

1. **Navigate to Provisioning Section**  
   In **Settings → Authentication**, scroll to the **"OIDC User Provisioning"** section (visible when OIDC is enabled)

2. **Enable Automatic Provisioning**  
   Toggle **"Automatic user provisioning"** to **ON**

3. **Select Default Permissions**  
   Choose which permissions new users should receive automatically:
   - **Read Books** - Always enabled by default (cannot be disabled)
   - Check additional permissions based on your user access policy
   - Consider starting with minimal permissions

4. **Select Default Libraries**  
   Choose which libraries new users can access:
   - Select from the dropdown list of available libraries
   - Multiple libraries can be selected
   - Users will only see books in their assigned libraries

5. **Save Settings**  
   Click **"Save Settings"** to apply the auto-provisioning configuration

:::success[Configuration Complete!]
Automatic user provisioning is now enabled. New users authenticating through OIDC will be automatically created with your configured defaults.
:::

## 🧪 Testing Auto-Provisioning

### Step 4: Test with a New User

Verify that automatic provisioning works correctly before rolling it out:

1. **Prepare Test Account**  
   Create a test user account in your OIDC provider (e.g., Pocket ID)
   - Use a username that doesn't exist in Booklore
   - Ensure the user has required attributes (email, name)
   - Verify the account is active in the OIDC provider

2. **Attempt Login**  
   - Open a private/incognito browser window
   - Navigate to your Booklore instance
   - Click "Login with [Provider Name]"
   - Authenticate with the test user credentials in your OIDC provider

3. **Verify User Creation**  
   After successful authentication:
   - User should be logged into Booklore immediately
   - Navigate to **Settings → Users** (admin access required)
   - Verify the new user appears in the user list
   - Check that the user has correct username, email, and display name

   ![Verify User](/img/authentication/auto-provisioning/auto-provision-3--verify-user-creation.jpg)

4. **Verify Permissions**  
   Click on the newly created user to view their details:
   - Confirm assigned permissions match your configuration
   - Verify library access is set correctly
   - Test that the user can perform actions according to their permissions

5. **Test User Experience**  
   Log in as the provisioned user and verify:
   - Access to assigned libraries
   - Ability to use granted permissions
   - Restrictions on non-granted permissions work correctly

:::tip[Keep Test Accounts]
Don't delete test accounts immediately. They're useful for verifying permission changes and troubleshooting issues that arise later.

## 🔄 Managing Provisioned Users

### Viewing Auto-Provisioned Users

All users, whether manually created or auto-provisioned, appear in the same user management interface:

1. **Navigate to Users**  
   Go to **Settings → Users** to view all user accounts

2. **Identify Authentication Method**  
   - Users have an authentication source indicator
   - OIDC-authenticated users are marked accordingly
   - You can filter or sort by authentication method

### Modifying Provisioned User Permissions

Auto-provisioned users start with default permissions, but you can customize them individually:

1. **Select User**  
   Click on a user in the user management list

2. **Edit Permissions**  
   - Grant additional permissions as needed
   - Add or remove library access
   - Changes take effect immediately

3. **Save Changes**  
   Click **"Save"** to apply permission modifications

:::note[Individual Overrides]
Changes made to individual users persist even if you later modify the default auto-provisioning settings. Default settings only affect newly provisioned users.
:::

### Disabling User Accounts

If you need to revoke access for an auto-provisioned user:

1. **Navigate to User Details**  
   Go to **Settings → Users** and select the user

2. **Disable Account**  
   - Toggle the account status to "Disabled"
   - Or remove all permissions and library access
   - Or delete the user account entirely

3. **Next Login Behavior**  
   - Disabled users cannot log in even if OIDC authentication succeeds
   - Deleted users will be re-provisioned on next login if auto-provisioning is enabled

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Controlling Auto-Provisioning

**When to Enable:**

✅ You trust your OIDC provider to authenticate legitimate users  
✅ You want to minimize administrative overhead  
✅ Default permissions align with your security policy  
✅ Your OIDC provider has proper account management controls  
✅ You're comfortable with self-service account creation

**When to Disable:**

❌ You need to review and approve each user manually  
❌ Your OIDC provider allows unrestricted account creation  
❌ Users require different permission sets based on their role  
❌ You need strict control over library access  
❌ Compliance requires manual account approval

### Best Practices

- 🔒 **Start Restrictive** - Begin with minimal default permissions
- 👥 **Regular Audits** - Periodically review auto-provisioned users
- 📊 **Monitor Activity** - Track which users are being provisioned
- 🔐 **OIDC Provider Security** - Ensure your OIDC provider has strong authentication
- 🚪 **Claim Validation** - Verify claim mappings are correct before enabling
- 🛡️ **Backup Admin** - Maintain internal admin accounts as backup access
- 📝 **Document Policies** - Clearly define auto-provisioning policies for your organization

### Preventing Unauthorized Access

**OIDC Provider Controls:**
- Implement strong authentication in your OIDC provider
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible
- Control who can create accounts in your OIDC provider
- Monitor and audit OIDC provider access logs

**Booklore Controls:**
- Set minimal default permissions
- Limit default library access to public or general libraries
- Regularly review and audit provisioned users
- Disable auto-provisioning if unauthorized users are created
- Monitor Booklore access logs for suspicious activity
