# 🎯 Bookdrop Advanced Features

Bookdrop has 2 more advanced tools to assist with importing large collections into Booklore
- Bulk Edit
- Pattern Extraction

## ✏️ Bulk Edit Metadata

Apply the same metadata changes to multiple books at once.

### How to Use

1. **Select files** using checkboxes, or the **"Select All"** button
2. Click **"Bulk Edit"** button in toolbar
3. **Edit fields** you want to change:
   - Text: Series Name, Publisher, Language
   - Number: Series Total
   - Arrays: Authors, Genres, Moods, Tags
4. Choose **Merge** (add new data to existing metadata) or **Replace** (overwrite) for array fields
5. Click **"Apply to Selected"**

:::tip
Only checked fields will be updated. Fields are auto-checked when you enter values, but make sure any fields you want to set a ticked.
:::

**Example:** Update 150 comic issues with the same series name and publisher in seconds.

## 🔍 Pattern Extraction

Automatically extract metadata from filenames using patterns.

### How to Use

1. **Select files** to process, or the use **"Select All"** button
2. Click **"Extract Pattern"** button
3. **Enter a pattern** or choose one of the existing ones (You can modify these after selection)
4. **Preview** results on sample files
5. Click **"Extract and Apply"**

### Pattern Syntax

**Placeholders** (capture metadata):
- Text: `{Title}`, `{SeriesName}`, `{Authors}`, `{Publisher}`, `{Language}`, `{Subtitle}`
- Numbers: `{SeriesNumber}`, `{SeriesTotal}`
- Identifiers: `{ISBN10}`, `{ISBN13}`, `{ASIN}`
- Dates: `{Published}`, `{Published:yyyy-MM-dd}`, `{Published:yyyy}`

**Wildcard** (skip text without extraction): `*`

**Literal text:** Everything else matches exactly as shown, dashes, spaces etc. So adding in ` - ` between 2 placeholders would require that ` - ` is present between those placeholders in the filename for a successful match.

### Example Patterns

**Books:**
```
{Authors} - {Title}
{Title} ({Published:yyyy})
{Authors} - {Title} ({Published:yyyy})
```

**Series/Comics:**
```
{SeriesName} #{SeriesNumber}
{SeriesName} - Chapter {SeriesNumber}
{SeriesName} v{SeriesNumber} (of {SeriesTotal})
[*] {SeriesName} - Chapter {SeriesNumber}
```

### Pattern Examples

| Filename | Pattern | Result |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `John Smith - The Lost City.epub` | `{Authors} - {Title}` | Authors="John Smith"<br/>Title="The Lost City" |
| `Chronicles #025.cbz` | `{SeriesName} #{SeriesNumber}` | Series="Chronicles"<br/>Number=25 |
| `The Book (2023).epub` | `{Title} ({Published})` | Title="The Book"<br/>Year=2023 |
| `[Tag] Series - Ch 5.cbz` | `[*] {SeriesName} - Ch {SeriesNumber}` | Series="Series"<br/>Number=5 |

### Date Formats

While Booklore will attempt to automatically detect the right date format to match what is given, you can explicitly tell it the format to override any auto-detection. This is useful when a date is ambigious.

The below are some example formats that can be given to a date placeholder:

| Format | Example | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `yyyy-MM-dd` | 2023-05-15 | ISO standard |
| `MM-dd-yyyy` | 05-15-2023 | US format |
| `dd.MM.yyyy` | 15.05.2023 | European |
| `yyyyMMdd` | 20230515 | Compact |
| `yyyy` | 2023 | Year only |

Tokens: `yyyy`=year, `MM`=month, `dd`=day, `M`=1-2 digit month, `d`=1-2 digit day

:::note
When using `yyyy` it'll default the day/month to the first of January when adding to the book metadata, as Booklore requires a full date value

## 💡 Quick Tips

**Pattern Extraction:**
- Always preview before extracting to see the data that will be pulled from the files
- For files with extremely different patterns, I would suggest editing them in "groups" rather than trying to make 1 perfect pattern to fit wildly different filename styles
- Use wildcards `*` for any parts that vary between files

**Bulk Edit:**
- Only enable fields you want to change, enabling a blank field will replace it with a blank value
- For array fields, merge will attempt to merge the data already there with what you set, while replace will override it
- Press Enter after each value in array fields to add multiple values to those fields

**Combining Features:**
1. Use Pattern Extraction to get metadata from filenames, useful for getting details like a books position in its series from the filename
2. Use Bulk Edit to add consistent series info, publishers, or tags across multiple files

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Pattern doesn't match:**
- Check literal text matches exactly (spaces, dashes, etc) and use a wildcard if in doubt
- Compare pattern to actual filenames character-by-character
- Start from a simple pattern, and add to it while checking the preview to see what's failing

**Dates wrong:**
- Specify explicit format: `{Published:MM-dd-yyyy}` for a date formated like `02-20-2025` in the filename

**Bulk edit not applying:**
- Verify fields are checked
- Ensure values are entered
- Check selection count

You can always review the extracted or bulk metadata prior to finalizing the import by clicking on each book.
