## Cover Cropping

Automatically crop oversized cover images to prevent display issues. This is particularly useful for web comics and manga that often have very tall images as their first page.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Cover Cropping** | Crops images that exceed the aspect ratio threshold (disabled by default) |
| **Smart Cropping** | Skips solid-color areas at the top of the image to avoid blank cropped results |
| **Aspect Ratio Threshold** | Sets the threshold for how much larger the image has to be before it gets cropped |

When enabled, covers exceeding the configured height-to-width ratio will be cropped from the top to fit standard cover dimensions.
